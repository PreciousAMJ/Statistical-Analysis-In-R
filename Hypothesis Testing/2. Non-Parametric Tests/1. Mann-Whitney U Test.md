Mann-Whitney U Test in R
================

### *Introduction*

A Mann-Whitney U test is typically performed when an analyst would like
to test for differences between two independent treatments or
conditions. However, the continuous response variable of interest is not
normally distributed. For example, you may want to know if first-years
students scored differently on an exam when compared to second-year
students, but the exam scores for at **least one group** do not follow a
normal distribution. The Mann-Whitney U test is often considered a
nonparametric alternative to an independent sample t-test. The
Mann-Whitney U test is also known as the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon,
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney, and the Wilcoxon Rank Sum.

A Mann-Whitney U test is typically performed when each experimental
unit, (study subject) is only assigned one of the two available
treatment conditions. Thus, the treatment groups do not have overlapping
membership and are considered *independent* i.e not paired. A
Mann-Whitney U test is considered a “between-subjects” analysis.

Formally, the null hypothesis is that the distribution functions of both
populations are equal. The alternative hypothesis is that the
distribution functions are not equal.

Informally, we are testing to see if mean ranks differ between groups.
*Since mean ranks approximate the median*, many time analysts will
indicate that we are testing for median differences even though this may
not be considered formally correct. For this reason, many times
descriptive statistics regarding median values are provided when the
Mann-Whitney U test is performed.

Import the dataset

``` r
setwd("C:\\Users\\HP\\Documents\\Datasets")

Diabetes_Data <- read_csv("C:\\Users\\HP\\Documents\\Datasets\\Diabetes Dataset.csv")
```

Let’s create different data frames for female and male

``` r
Female <- Diabetes_Data %>%
  filter(gender == "female")

Male <- Diabetes_Data %>%
  filter(gender == "male")
```

Next, we’ll create variables for the stable blood glucose for males and
females

``` r
Female_Stab_Glu <- Female$stab.glu

Male_Stab_Glu <- Male$stab.glu
```

Let’s tale a look at the summary of our data

``` r
summary(Female_Stab_Glu)
```

    ##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
    ##    52.0    81.0    89.0   102.6   105.0   299.0

``` r
summary(Male_Stab_Glu)
```

    ##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
    ##    48.0    81.0    89.0   112.2   111.0   385.0

### Normality Tests

Prior to performing the Mann-Whitney U, it is important to evaluate our
assumptions to ensure that we are performing an appropriate and reliable
comparison. If normality is present, an independent samples t-test would
be a more appropriate test.

Testing normality should be performed using a Shapiro-Wilk normality
test (or equivalent), and/or a QQ plots for large sample sizes. Many
times, histograms can also be helpful..

In this example, we will use the shapiro.test function from the stats
package to produce our Shapiro-Wilk normality test for each variable,
and use plots to view distributions.

``` r
hist(Female_Stab_Glu, col = "pink")
```

```

```

The outputs shows that the stable blood glucose distribution for both
genders is skewed to the left, which means that a non-parametric test is
the suitable test to determine if there’s a difference between both
variables.

### *perform shapiro-wilk test*

``` r
shapiro.test(Female_Stab_Glu)
```

    ## 
    ##  Shapiro-Wilk normality test
    ## 
    ## data:  Female_Stab_Glu
    ## W = 0.68032, p-value < 2.2e-16

``` r
shapiro.test(Male_Stab_Glu)
```

    ## 
    ##  Shapiro-Wilk normality test
    ## 
    ## data:  Male_Stab_Glu
    ## W = 0.6388, p-value < 2.2e-16

A p-value \< 0.05 would indicate that we should reject the assumption of
normality. The Shapiro-Wilk Test p-values for both stable glucose groups
are \< 0.05 and therefore, not normally distributed.

### *Perform the Mann-Whitney U test*

``` r
Model <- wilcox.test(Female_Stab_Glu, Male_Stab_Glu, na.rm=TRUE, paired=FALSE, exact=FALSE, conf.int=TRUE)

print(Model)
```

    ## 
    ##  Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction
    ## 
    ## data:  Female_Stab_Glu and Male_Stab_Glu
    ## W = 18946, p-value = 0.4737
    ## alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0
    ## 95 percent confidence interval:
    ##  -5.000031  2.000011
    ## sample estimates:
    ## difference in location 
    ##              -1.000037

W – This value represents the Wilcoxon test statistic. The Wilcoxon test
statistic is the sum of the ranks in sample 1 minus n1\*(n1+1)/2. n1 is
the number of observations in sample 1.

p-value – The p-value corresponding to the two-sided test based on the
standard normal (Z) distribution.

95% confidence interval – The 95% confidence interval on the difference
between the stable glucose level for females and males.

difference in location – This value corresponds to the Hodges-Lehmann
Estimate of the location parameter differences the two groups.

The Mann-Whitney U test results in a two-sided test p-value = 0.4737.
This indicates that we should fail to reject the null hypothesis that
distributions are equal and conclude that there is no significant
difference in stable blood glucose between both genders.

The Mann-Whitney U test is typically used as a last resort. This is
because it is a lower power test when compared to the independent
samples t-test.

More modern alternatives include permutation/randomization tests,
bootstrap confidence intervals, and transforming the data but each
option will have its own stipulations.

If you need to compare more than two independent groups, *a one-way
Analysis of Variances (ANOVA) or Kruskal-Wallis* test may be
appropriate.

A Mann-Whitney U test is not appropriate if you have repeated
measurements taken on the same experimental unit (subject). For example,
if you have a pre-test post-test study, then each subject would be
measured at two different time points. If this is the case, then *a
paired t-test or corresponding nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test*
may be a more appropriate course of action.
